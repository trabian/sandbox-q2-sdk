This repo is a template for starting a new project without the help of Q2. 

Normally, Q2 will create a GitLab repo for a new project under a specific stack. However, since we only want to create a sandbox project, this repo will suffice.

WARNING: This repo may depreciate if Q2 updates their current template files. Update the SDK version using `q2 upgrade` when using this repo.
